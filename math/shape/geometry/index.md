## Fundamentals

### Points, Lines, and Planes
point
: a dimensionless dot

line
: an endless one-dimensional entity; through any two points exactly one line exists

plane
: a two-dimensional surface; through any three points not on the same line, there exists exactly one plane

A set of points are said to be *collinear* when they lie on a same point, and the same applied to *coplanar* lines.

#### Lines
Lines are represented as ${\overset{\leftrightarrow}{AB}}$. A **line segment** is a line that has a definite start and end, represented as $\overline{AB}$. A **ray** has a definite start but continues in one directions infinitely, and is represented as $\overrightarrow{AB}$. Rays and line segments can be collinear.

#### Intersections
Geometric figures intersect when they share one or more points. The resulting intersection is one dimension less than the objects.

### Use Segments and Congruence
A rule that has no proof is a *postulate*.

**Postulate 2. Ruler Postulate** The distance between two points can be matched one-to-one with real numbers. For a straight line segment $\overline{AB}$, with endpoints with $x$-coordinates $x_1$ and $x_2$, its length is $|x_2 - x_1|$.

**Postulate 3. Segment Addition Postulate** If point $B$ is between points $A$ and $C$, then $\overline{AB} + \overline{BC} = \overline{AC}$, and vice versa.
